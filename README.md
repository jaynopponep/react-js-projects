A collection of fun projects made with Vite + ReactJS, Firebase, HTML/CSS.

**Contents:**
A sample react website - My first time working on ReactJS and soon-to-be a personal portfolio site, I integrate my understanding of the usage of react router dom, Firebase user authentication integration, etc. 

**Purpose:**
To learn and strengthen my skills in React; there is always more room to learn.

**Installation:**
- **Running on Webstorm:**
  - Make sure Node.js is already installed on your computer: https://nodejs.org/en
  - Initialize WebStorm project on Vite; given that Node.js is installed, an interpreter for node.js should be available to select when initializing a project
  - Run ||npm install react-router-dom|| in terminal
